I don't have the full content of the `src/pages/SignalDetail.tsx` file in the provided information, so I can't generate the complete file. The AI only mentioned making a small change to add optional chaining to some properties.

Based on the AI's comment, the change was to replace:
```
data.profiles.full_name || 'No name',
data.profiles.phone_number || 'No phone',
data.profiles.city || 'No city',
data.profiles.address || 'No address',
```

With:
```
data.profiles?.full_name || 'No name',
data.profiles?.phone_number || 'No phone',
data.profiles?.city || 'No city',
data.profiles?.address || 'No address',
```

Without seeing the full file, I cannot provide the complete code with these changes properly integrated. I would need to see the entire `src/pages/SignalDetail.tsx` file to provide an accurate full version with the changes applied.
